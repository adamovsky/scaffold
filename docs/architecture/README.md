# Architecture

The architecture's cornerstone of this scaffold is simplicity.

Our target audience is the junior engineer despite whether we will have junior engineer or not. The reason for this is that with this being our guiding principle we will inherently write clearer code. As a result our code will be easy to reason through for everyone regardless of skill level.

Simplicity in any architecture is key to maintainability, testability, stability, scalability, and easy-of-troubleshooting.

Remember that it is more difficult to write simple code to solve complex problems than it is to write over-engineered code. The engineering within this architecture begs the engineer to take time to reason through the solution through the lens of a lesser-skilled third person.

The elegance of our solutions is achieved by simplicity not complexity.
