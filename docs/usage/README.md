# Usage

This scaffold _is_ your project. Once cloned, continue your work inside this code base.

## Familiarization

The first step is to go through the code and understand how everything is wired up.

The _why_ is not as important in the beginning, but definitely something that _should_ interest you to make you a stronger engineer. Rest assured that all decisions made within this architecture have been carefully thought through, so if something doesn't make sense today, revisit it at a later date.

## Trimming

The second step is to remove everything that you do not believe that you will need. 

Before removing anything, make sure that you understand what it is that you are removing for you may need to bring it back later.

The goal is to have you keep only what you absolutely need.
