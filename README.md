# CleanDX React Scaffold

This is a scaffold project that allows you to get up and running very quickly while aligning with a CleanDX architecture.

It uses the following technologies:

-   CRA (create-react-app)
-   Recoil or Redux Toolkit (configurable via .env configuration)
-   Storybook
-   Sass
-   CSS modules
-   ESlint

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/adamovsky/scaffold.git
cd scaffold
./setup.sh
```

## Get Started

The first thing you will most likely do is to rename the folder from `scaffold` to the name of your project.

## Credit

Please include somewhere in your project that your project is scaffolded from https://github.com/adamovsky/scaffold.git
